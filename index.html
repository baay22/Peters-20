                <h5 style="padding-top: 20px;">S&P 500 Index: 1970-2022</h5>
                <p style="padding-top: 15px;">This chart shows the growth of $10,000 based on S&P 500 Index performance over the last several decades. We believe looking at the market's overall resiliency through major crises and events helps to gain a fresh perspective on the benefits of investing for the long term.</p>

The S&P 500 index is an unmanaged index of 500 companies used to measure large-cap U.S. stock market performance. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.

These returns are total returns and were the result of certain market factors and events which may not be repeated in the future</i></p>
                <h1 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-left: 25px;">STAYING THE COURSE</h1>
                <p style="padding-top: 15px;">Investors tend to see short-term volatility as the enemy. Volatility may lead many investors to move money out of the market and "sit on the sidelines" until things "calm down." Although this approach may appear to solve one problem, it creates several others:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>When do you get back in? You must make two correct decisions back-to-back; when to get out and when to get back in.</li>
                    <li>By going to the sidelines you may be missing a potential rebound. This is not historically unprecedented; see chart below.</li>
                    <li>By going to the sidelines you could be not only missing a potential rebound, but all the potential growth on that money going forward.</li>
                </ol>
                <p style="padding-top: 20px;">We believe the wiser course of action is to review your plan with your advisor(s) and from there, decide if any action is indeed necessary. This placates the natural desire to "do something," but helps keep emotions in check.</p>

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Monthly data September 2007 - March 2022. Housing data through January 2022 and CPI data through February 2022 (latest data available). Stocks represented by the S&P 500 Total Return Index. Gold represented by gold spot price per Troy ounce. 10-Year Treasury represented by 10-year Treasury note constant maturity total return index.

Oil prices represented by the NYM Generic 1st Crude Futures Index. This chart is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any actual investment. The asset classes shown here offer different characteristics in terms of income, tax treatment, capital appreciation, and risk. Common stocks are subject to risks, such as an economic recession and the possible deterioration of either the financial condition of the issuers of the equity securities or the general condition of the stock market. An investment in commodities involves specific risks including but not limited to: global supply and demand, depletion of natural resources, excess capacity, production costs, economic recession, domestic and international politics, currency exchange rates, government relations, volatile interest rates, consumer spending trends, and overall capital spending levels. Fixed income securities are generally subject to credit risk, income risk, and interest rate risk. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer may default on its obligation to make principal and/or interest payments when due. Income risk is the risk that income could decline during periods of falling interest rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of fixed income securities will decline because of rising interest rates. Homebuilding companies can be significantly affected by the national, regional and local real estate markets. </i></p>

                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-left: 70px;">The average Bull Market period lasted 4.4 years with an average cumulative total return of 154.9%.</li>

                <p style="padding-top: 15px;">Below we look at the S&P Index since 1926 and compare the average annual total returns of the last 96 years. Although stock market returns fluctuate significantly, since 1926, the S&P 500 Index produced positive return 74% of the time, with an average of 21.3%. In 26% of those years the return was negative, with an average of -13.2%.</p>

                <p style="padding-top: 15px;">Investing in the stock market can be volatile. For this reason, we believe it is important to keep proper perspective when stocks rise or fall over short periods of time. History has shown that the odds of achieving a positive return are dramatically increased the longer the investment horizon.</p>

                <p style="padding-top: 15px;">The chart below lists the 15 largest single-day percentage losses in the S&P 500 Index since 1960 and the subsequent price performance of the index for the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods that followed. Looking back, the S&P Index produced positive price appreciation, on average, in each of the periods.
